# GoogleDriveAPISpringboot

## Introduction

This Springboot Project completed some Google Drive API features including Google account sign in, file uploading, folder creating, and file uploading to folders.

## Installation

Download all the code and put it into a folder, then import into Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.


## Project Description
The main source code is in src/main/java/com/gdrive/sbt/drivelistfiles/controller/HomepageController.java
src/main/resources/static/index.html is the html for Log in page
src/main/resources/static/dashboard.html is the html for the page after log in
src/main/resources/static/scripts/index.js contents the javascrpts code

## How to use
To use your own Google Cloud project to run this project, you need to create Oauth client credentials and download the json file. Then replace the jason file in src/main/resources/keys and src/main/resources/credentials. 

Change the path name shown in the image if you want to upload your own file:

Change the folder ID and pathname of file if you want to upload a file to a folder:
